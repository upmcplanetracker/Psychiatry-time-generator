# Appointment Time Generator üóìÔ∏è

A simple, offline, browser-based tool for generating realistic E&M (Evaluation and Management) and therapy time slots for medical documentation.

This tool helps create varied and plausible time entries for 30-minute and 60-minute appointments, adding slight, randomized offsets to start times and durations to mimic real-world scenarios.
